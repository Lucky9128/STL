OOPs:

Abstraction:
Data abstraction refers to, providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, 
For example, a database system hides certain details of how data is stored and created and maintained.

Encapsulation:
 it is not always clear which functions work on which variables but object-oriented programming provides you 
 framework to place the data and the relevant functions together in the same object
 
polymorphism comes in picture with inheritance and 
overloading in the same class


storage classes:

auto : by default and scope is local;
register : local varibales those are stored in register(but this not necessary it depends on H/W and implementation restrictions)


global varibales:
they are accessed in other file by the help of extern keyword
